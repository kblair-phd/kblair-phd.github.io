Milk & Honey Mamas is a website I run meeting children where they are with theological ideas and practices. As a mother, I believe deeply that our fervent desire to nourish and delight our children is a spiritual heritage. I believe that children are intelligent, creative, and insightful humans who do not need our theological crumbs. They need the full meal, at the big table, laden with milk and honey.

I run this website with two colleagues. You can check out the main website here: <a href="https://themilkandhoneymamas.com/">https://themilkandhoneymamas.com/</a>.
