Hi, I'm Kristen Blair!

I am a Ph.D. student in theology at the University of Toronto. I specialize in practical theology, with additional expertise in theopoetics, environmental theologies, and theologies of atonement and kenosis.

I am also a mother, deeply comitted to my children and family. I think carefully in my work about caretaking (of children, the environment, and each other), invisible labor, and lived theology. Most of my current research addresses the role of care-taking in theological practices and experiences. 

This website houses my published and ongoing theological projects across a variety of mediums, including academic articles, conference presentations, blogs, Instagram, poetry, and more.

Please feel free to get in touch!
