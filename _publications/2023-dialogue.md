excerpt: 'There is in every person an inward sea, and in that sea there is an island and on that island there is an altar and standing guard before that altar is the &quot;angel with the flaming sword.&quot; Nothing can get by that angel to
be placed upon that altar unless it has the mark of your inner authority. Nothing passes &quot;the angel with the flaming sword&quot; to be placed upon your altar unless it be a part of &quot;the fluid area of your consent.&quot; This is
your crucial link with the Eternal.'

In this article, I argue that Howard Thurman, the famed theologian, prioritizes agency in similar ways to Latter-day Saint theologies, but with a nuanced understanding that illuminates the areas where the LDS cosmic drama has grown murky. For Thurman, the importance of agency is less about capacity for moral action toward a determined end (i.e., control over salvation versus damnation) and more about awareness of one’s internal landscape and the immutable language of one’s eternal soul, wherein one finds spiritual power and peace. I argue that this perspective tracks with the Latter-day
Saint framework in theory but not in rhetorical practice.
